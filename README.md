### Favorite Toppings

This was an exercise for NSS C#/.Net

A pizza chain wants to know which topping combinations are most popular for Build Your Own pizzas.

Given the sample of orders at [http://files.olo.com/pizzas.json](http://files.olo.com/pizzas.json), write an application (in C# or JavaScript) to output the top 20 most
frequently ordered pizza configurations, listing the toppings for each
along with the number of times that pizza configuration has been
ordered.

Check this link [to read a JSON file](https://www.newtonsoft.com/json/help/html/DeserializeWithJsonSerializerFromFile.htm) in c#. You'll need to install the Newtonsoft.Json nuget package, and create a class that represents the pizzas.
